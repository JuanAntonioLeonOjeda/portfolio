# Spec-driven change

For changes to the site itself (a new section, project detail pages, a blog, a new language…).
Adding or updating a project follows `/new-project` instead.

## Steps

0. **Branch** from an up-to-date `develop` (`.claude/workflows/git-workflow.md`).
1. **Short plan, then stop.** In the conversation: goal, what will be built, decisions that
   need the author, risks, what must be verified first. **Wait for confirmation.**
2. **Spec** (`specs/<name>/spec.md`): what it solves, out of scope, acceptance criteria as
   given/when/then, open questions. Do not continue while questions remain.
3. **Tasks** (`specs/<name>/tasks.md`): ordered checklist, each task one or a few commits.
4. **Implement task by task**, committing as you go. Anything the plan did not foresee goes
   into the spec first. New UI follows the `frontend-design` skill.
5. **Tests** per `.claude/rules/testing-conventions.md`.
6. **Review**: `ts-reviewer`; `accessibility-reviewer` for UI; `content-reviewer` for copy;
   `code-reviewer` for a general pass when the diff is large.
7. **Close**: update `AGENTS.md`; ADR if a decision was taken
   (`.claude/workflows/architecture-decision.md`); rebuild the Docker image.

## When to skip steps

Typos, wording, a number or status update or a dependency patch bump do not need a spec: a
branch, a small commit and green checks.
